IJMB: Do you know that the Interim Joint Matriculation Board (IJMB) examination is one of the best kept open secrets to get admission to a Nigerian university? Or that <b>ALEVELS LINKS PRIME RC: 3022788</b> is the most recognized and Registered IJMB study centre in the country with an excellent pedigree of helping students gain admission to a university spanning over a decade? <br/><br/>
Every year, hundreds of thousands of students have to endure the frustration of missing out on university admission. For many of those students, that failure has little to do with their performance at the yearly Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) organized by the <a href="https://www.jamb.org.ng/">Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB)</a> <br/> <br/>
A candidate could pass the UTME with flying colours and still miss out on admission. The latest figures from JAMB indicate that over 1.6 million candidates sat for the UTME. But only 30% are likely to get admission to a university of their choice. <br/> <br/>
Comparatively, the statistics for the number of candidates who are admitted to Universities through Interim Joint Matriculation Board (IJAMB) is literally more than the JAMB admission stats. <br/> <br/>
For instance, of the about 30,000+ IJMB applicants annually: <br/> <br/>
•	There is a 93% pass rate <br/>
•	81% successful admission rate to a university <br/>
•	75% of those admitted get to read their first choice course <br/> <br/>
The gulf between students seeking admission in Nigerian tertiary institutions and the actual number admitted through the UTME would continue to grow in the coming years. <br/><br/>
In other words, unless an alternative is found, many more candidates would keep seeing their dreams of becoming a university student crash.<br/><br/>
For many years now, that alternative is IJMB and many students studying in universities today owe their good fortune to the comprehensive guidance they got through <b>ALEVELS LINKS PRIME RC: 3022788</b>.<br/> <br/>
<h4>What is Interim Joint Matriculation Board (IJMB)?</h4> <br/><br/>
The Interim Joint Matriculation Board (IJMB) was established in 1976 by the Interim Common Services Agency of the old Northern Regional Government of Nigeria.<br/><br/>
Interim Joint Matriculation Board at inception had two basic functions: to provide social services and educational opportunities to people of the Northern region of the country. Now though, it has grown to encompass the whole country providing the best pathway to university education in the country.<br/><br/>
Since the beginning, Interim Joint Matriculation Board has been moderated and coordinated by one of Nigeria’s premier tertiary universities, the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. The program also has coordinating bodies in various tertiary institutions around the country.<br/><br/>
To make it accessible to as many Nigerians as possible, there are accredited IJMB centres across the country of which IJMBCENTRES is one of the foremost. <br/><br/>
<b>Eligibility</b><br/><br/>
The program is open to all Nigerians with the requisite O’Level qualifications. Candidates who are also awaiting their O’Level result are eligible to apply for the programme. <br/> <br/>
<b>Courses/subjects categories</b> <br/><br/>
There are no restrictions in the categories of subjects in Interim Joint Matriculation Board. Science, Arts and Social Science students are eligible to apply as long as they fulfil the eligibility criteria. <br/> <br/>
Candidates who enrol for the program are required to choose three ‘A’ Level subjects for the IJMB examination. <br/> <br/>
These subjects, one of which must be English Language, should be related to the candidate’s intended course of study at the university. <br/> <br/>
Candidates are then expected to receive lectures at the study centres of their choice to prepare them for the exams. <br/> <br/>
That is why it is imperative for candidates to select the best study centres available to ensure they come out of the program with excellent results. <br/><br/>
<b>Duration of program</b> <br/><br/>
Officially, IJMB is a 9 months program. Lectures start between March and April and run through to the whole year. The exams proper start sometime in January or the first week of February the following year. <br/><br/>
It is a three weeks exams with the results expected to be released by the end of April. <br/><br/>
At <b>ALEVELS LINKS PRIME RC: 3022788</b>, candidates are encouraged to enrol at the centre early as we believe getting excellent results are directly linked to early preparation. <br/><br/>
For that reason, registration starts in November and end in April of the following year. Lectures are scheduled to start between March and April. <br/><br/>
So it’s best to get the registration sorted out early so we can all get down to preparing for the examination without distractions. <br/><br/>
<b>Why IJMB is important</b> <br/><br/>
It is now clear that the Interim Joint Matriculation Board pathway is the best alternative to getting admission to Nigerian universities outside of the JAMB-organized UTME. With Interim Joint Matriculation Board , candidates are placed in a highly organized and structured environment to aid them to excel in the Interim Joint Matriculation Board examination. <br/><br/>
Apart from that, going through Interim Joint Matriculation Board in an accredited study centre like ALEVELS LINKS PRIME RC: 3022788 ensures that candidates are given a peep into how lectures and studies are done in a real university in Nigeria. <br/><br/>
This is important as many new students find it hard to cope with the university environment after secondary school where everything is organized for the student. <br/><br/>
Other reasons why Interim Joint Matriculation Board is the way to go include: <br/><br/>
•	It is recognized by the National Universities Commission (NUC) as a program leading to an advanced level certification in the chosen subjects. <br/>
•	Successful candidates gain admission to the university via Direct Entry. That means they get into 200 level, skipping the first year of university since the Interim Joint Matriculation Board program is equivalent to the first year of university. <br/>
•	The Interim Joint Matriculation Board A’level result is recognized around the world as a valid A’Level certification. <br/>
•	Unlike JAMB, successful Interim Joint Matriculation Board, candidates don’t have to repeat the examination. It is a lifetime certificate that would always remain valid to be used at any time in the future. <br/><br/>
<h4>How to use the Interim Joint Matriculation Board Result to gain admission</h4> <br/><br/>
The Interim Joint Matriculation Board can be used to gain admission into the 200 level in any approved Nigerian University. <br/><br/>

3. In the form, you have the option of choosing your preferred university (first option) and an alternate choice (second option). You are allowed to make up to six choices <br/><br/>
The course you chose would be directly related to how well you perform in the IJMB examination. That is why it is important to choose a quality study centre. <br/><br/>
A good IJMB study centre combined with hard work and diligent study would surely guarantee your Interim Joint Matriculation Board result would get you any course you desire. <br/><br/>
<b>Universities that accept IJMB Candidates</b> <br/><br/>

All the universities in Northern Nigeria accept students with IJMB result. In the south, over 75% of the universities, whether federal, state or private, accept successful IJMB candidates into various courses in the respective universities. <br/><br/>
